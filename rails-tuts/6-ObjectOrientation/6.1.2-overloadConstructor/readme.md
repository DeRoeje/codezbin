## Modules ##
Used to wrap around code, to be included in several places, an example would be to wrap around a class or bunch of classes using a module. They can be used for namespacing to avoid naming conflicst. 

The classic example, two students with the same name, say Alex, and the professor call on Alex and bot of them respond. So the teacher might do something to distinguish them when calling them. Namespacing the same idea and modules are useful for that purpose. Also in mixins that I'll talk about in the next video.
