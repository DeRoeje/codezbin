findPosition method:

 // find the appropriate pointer depending 
on the time/date of the new event
  that is going to be added.

if the new event that is going to 
be added,is latest compared to the other
ones, make the runner go all the way to the end
 until it hits null and the new event will be added to the end (insertAtTail)

then grab that pointer and used it to point to 
the new event that 
is going to be added.
