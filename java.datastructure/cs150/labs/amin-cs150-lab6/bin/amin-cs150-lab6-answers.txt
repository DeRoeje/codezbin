1 - The worst-case is when  the findPosition method has to go through all the pointers in order to find the position of the new node 
 at the very end of the linkedList. This depends on the number of current nodes and if there are n nodes, this method has to go through 
n nodes. Therefore, it is a linear process, O(n).

The worst-case running time for insertAfter method is O(1). The reason is that this method does not depend on the all of the nodes in the
 linkedList but only one. Therefore, when the method is called, it always updates same number of pointers. Therefore, it is a constant process.

2 – The worst-case is when the method has to go through all the elements in the array. If there are n element s in the array, the method 
has to do it n times. Therefore, it will be linear process, O(n). Similarly, the insert method in an array would be linear for same reason as above.

3) A linkedList would be better to implement using a linear search method for all the events in the beginning. This is because  the 
search method can go through all the beginning events very easily and efficiently.

4) An array would be better to implement. The reason is that the boss can access each event by knowing the index of the array. 
For example to know the last event, he can simply access the last index of the array without going  through all the elements in the array.
