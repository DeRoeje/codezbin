1) The methods setStart and setEnd are specific to the event class. If these two events 
   were placed in the interface, then the other class (reminder) would also implement these two methods.
   However, the reminder class for example does not have a way to refer to the variables start time and end time
   for certain events. The variables that the reminder class knows of are the month, day and year. In conclusion,
   it is more logical to place these two methods in the event class rather than the interface. 

2) This is not a good design because the reminder class, which implements the interface has to have
   the two variables startTime and endTime. Moreover, because of the behavior of this class (reminding 
   the year, month and day) it is not logical to place the setStart and setEnd in the reminder class.

3) It was necessary to use casting. The casting was done to tell the java compiler that LogEntry can be an Event.
   As a result, the compiler did not send an error.
