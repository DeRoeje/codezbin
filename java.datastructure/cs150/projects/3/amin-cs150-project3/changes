Changes made to the card and deck class:


DECK CLASS: The only changes made was that the new deck class can now accept an argument ("num") and make deck of cards based on that.
**************************************************


public Deck(int num)
		{
			deckTracker = 0;
			cardDeck = new Card[num*52];
			this.makeDeckOfCards(num);
		}	
**************************************************
				private void makeDeckOfCards(int num)
		{
			for(int j = 0; j < num; j++)
			{
				for (int i=0; i<13; i++)
				{
					for(int k=0;k<4;k++)
					{
					Card card = new Card(i+1 ,k);
					cardDeck[(i + (13 * k)) + (j*52)]=card;
					}
				}
			}
		}
**************************************************
**************************************************
CARD CLASS: The changes made were that the names of the card values  were replaced by number strings.
**************************************************	
			private  static String[] cardSuit =  {"clubs", "diamonds", "hearts", "spades"};
			private  static String[] cardValue = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13"};
